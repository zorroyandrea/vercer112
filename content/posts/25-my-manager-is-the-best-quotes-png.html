                Good management is the art of making problems so interesting and their solutions so constructive that everyone wants to get to work and deal with them. Naturally i would pick the parts that make me look good, and the hiring manager may feel suspicious about quotes out of context. I can no other answer make but thanks, and thanks, and ever thanks. a good manager is a man who isn&#039;t worried about his own career but rather the careers of those who work for him.

    <h3>If i had nine hours to chop down a tree, i&#039;d spend the first six sharpening my axe.</h3>
    <p>Often, it&#039;s the project manager who is the one who rallies the team and related: A manager is a person who is accountable for managing the company. If i had nine hours to chop down a tree, i&#039;d spend the first six sharpening my axe. Motivational quotes for work should be inspiring and empoweringâ€¦and should not sound like something you lifted from a cheesy greeting card.</p>
